Taking a look at the devices mentioned on the PDF, it shows how much
technology can influence and represent things in our society. The Abortion Drone
points out a clear problem in our society where women don't have access to free and 
reliable abortion methods. By using the drone, pills were delivered to women who
needed them.

Other devices I took interest in were the wearbale panic panic button,
the offline network router and the personal blackbox. Apart from the 
mystery spy feeling they had, it shows what measures must be taken for
protesters to be able to feel safe or warn each other when things may get bad.
