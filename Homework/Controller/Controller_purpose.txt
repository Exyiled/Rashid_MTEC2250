Light blue - temperature sensor
Green - small aracade joystick
purple and red - buttons.
Yellow - pulse sesnor

	The controller is bult for a game where players have to fly an 
object through different zones. The zones change based on temperature and humidity.
The buttons are used toshoot and eevade through obstacles that  may pop up. The sesnor
is used to detect incoming objects from further. I envisioned a top down game similar to 
galaga.
